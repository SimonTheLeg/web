               Hey Gophers,
               we are active again after a break and are happy to announce the next Frankfurt Gopher meetup.
               You are welcome with every amount of Go programming experience. So feel welcome to join us as a beginner and as an expert as well.
               We are currently not providing food at the meeting. So be prepared and grab a sandwich before coming to us or join others after the meeting for a dinner. They are plenty opportunities around our location.
               Looking forward to meet you
