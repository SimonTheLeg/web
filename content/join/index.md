We manage our meetup on [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/gophers-frm/).
Why? Because it lifts a lot of what has to be done for a meetup like managing RSVP status and members.
Also, you do not have to share your contact data with us.

So if you are interested in visiting a meetup just head there and join our next meetup.
Note: you have to have an account over there.
